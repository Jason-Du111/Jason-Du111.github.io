I'm a senior year undergraduate student from [School of Transportation](https://jt.jlu.edu.cn/), [Jilin University](https://jlu.edu.cn/). And I have been recommended to [School of Automotive](https://auto.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://tongji.edu.cn/) to study for a postgraduate degree. My research interest includes computer vision, autonomous driving and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei Tian](https://www.XXX.com/) from the Institute of Intelligent Vehicles of [School of Automotive](https://auto.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://tongji.edu.cn/).
